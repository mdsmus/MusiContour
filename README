MusiContour: musical contour relations calculator

by Marcos di Silva and Pedro Kröger (Genos Research Group [1])

This is a software to calculate and plot musical contour relations
operations. MusiContour can process contour related to parameters such
as pitch, duration, dynamics and chord density. This software provides
Contour Theories functions [2].

MusiContour had two names before its current one: Goiaba (2007), a
software developed to process musical contours, during Marcos di Silva
master's degree [3], and Villa-Lobos Contour module, a module of
Villa-Lobos [4], and is now independent.
