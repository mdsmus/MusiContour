Linux users must install also this dependency::

 sudo apt-get install python-tk python-matplotlib

Windows users
`````````````

Windows users must install manually all dependencies for MusiContour:
`Python 2.6 <http://www.python.org/download/windows/>`_, `Numpy
<http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/>`_, `Matplotlib
<http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`_ and `PIL
<http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/>`_.

Maybe after install it's necessary to associate gui.py filetype to
Python2.6. In the example, in the picture, Python is in::

 C:\Python26\pythonw.exe

Look at the the picture:
