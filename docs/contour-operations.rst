Contour Operations
==================

Contour theories provides many contour operations. Eight of them are
implemented in |VLCM|:

.. index:: Retrograde

Retrograde
----------

Reverse cseg.

For instance::

 A < 0 1 2 3 >

 Retrograde(A) = < 3 2 1 0 >

.. index:: Inversion

Inversion
---------

The cseg horizontal inversion. The cseg is renumbered under `Morris
(1987) <contour-theories.html>`_ inversion formula::

 I(x)n = (n - 1) - x

where n = contour cardinality and x is cpitch.

For instance::

 A < 5 3 4 1 2 0 >

 n = 6

 I(5)6 = (6 - 1) - 5 = 0
 I(3)6 = (6 - 1) - 3 = 2
 I(4)6 = (6 - 1) - 4 = 1
 I(1)6 = (6 - 1) - 1 = 4
 I(2)6 = (6 - 1) - 2 = 3
 I(0)6 = (6 - 1) - 0 = 5

Thus::

 Inversion(A) = <0 2 1 4 3 5>

.. index:: Rotation

Rotation
--------

In rotation the cseg is split and the primer cpitches become the
last ones. It accepts a rotation parameter.

For instance::

 A = < 0 1 2 3 >

 Rotation(A, 1) = < 1 2 3 0 >
 Rotation(A, 2) = < 2 3 0 1 >
 Rotation(A, 3) = < 3 0 1 2 >

.. index:: Normal form
.. index:: Translation

Normal form (translation)
-------------------------

A contour is in its Normal form when reenumerated in integers from 0
to lower cpitch to (n - 1) to highest cpitch, where n is the contour
cardinality. Normal form is accomplished by translation operation.

For instance::

 A = < 2 5 8 9 1 >
 Translation(A) = < 1 2 3 4 0 >

 B = < 3 34 21 55 >
 Translation(B) = < 0 2 1 3 >

.. index:: Prime form

Prime form
----------

The Prime form is calculated by Marvin and Laprade Prime Form
Algorithm `(1987) <contour-theories.html>`_::

 1) Translate, if not consecutive integers 0 to (n - 1):
 2) Invert, if [(n - 1) - last cpitch] < first cpitch
 3) Retrograde, if last cpitch < first cpitch

For instance::

 A < 3 0 2 1 >
 2) Inversion(A) = < 0 3 1 2 >

 B < 1 2 0 4 >
 1) Translation(B) = B' < 1 2 0 3>
 2) Invertion(B') = B'' < 2 1 3 0 >
 3) Retrograde(B'') = < 0 3 1 2 >

In this example, A and B have the same prime form::

 < 0 3 1 2 >

In GUI, Prime form operation returns also the contour segment class
number, like in Marvin and Laprade C-space segment-classes table
`(1987) <contour-theories.html>`_.

For example::

 A < 5 2 9 4 1 3 >
 Prime form(A) = 6-163 < 1 4 0 2 5 3 >

The pair 6-163 means cardinality and Prime form order.

.. index:: Comparison Matrix
.. index:: COM-Matrix

Comparison Matrix
-----------------

Comparison Matrix (also known as COM-Matrix) returns a matrix with
comparison between all elements of a contour. The result of a
comparison is 0, + ou -. The Comparison Matrix is described by `Morris
(1987) <contour-theories.html>`_.

For example, matrix for < 0 3 1 2 >::

   | 0 3 1 2
 -----------
 0 | 0 + + +
 3 | - 0 - -
 1 | - + 0 +
 2 | - + - 0

In this example, in the first line, all cpitches of cseg are compared
with first column element, 0. So, assuming that COM(a, b) is the
comparison function between a and b elements::

 COM(0, 0) = 0
 COM(0, 3) = +
 COM(0, 1) = +
 COM(0, 2) = +

 COM(3, 0) = -
 COM(3, 3) = 0
 COM(3, 1) = -
 COM(3, 2) = -

Internal diagonal
-----------------

The Internal diagonals are yanked from the Comparison matrix, from top
left to bottom right, above the main diagonal. The main diagonal is
filled by zeros.

In this figure, INT_1, INT_2, and INT_3 means internal diagonal 1, 2,
and 3. 

.. image:: figs/internal_diagonals.png

For this Comparison matrix, internal diagonals are::

 Internal diagonal(1) = < + - + >
 Internal diagonal(2) = < + - >
 Internal diagonal(3) = < + >

.. index:: Subsets

Subsets
-------

Returns subsets from a contour with a given cardinality.

For example, for a given contour A, all 3 elements subsets::

 A < 0 3 1 2 >
 Subsets(3) =  < 0 1 2 >, < 0 3 1 >, < 0 3 2 >, < 3 1 2 >
