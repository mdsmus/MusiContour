    cardinality
        The quality related to the contour size. The number of
        elements of a contour.

    contour
        Shape, format or outline of an object.

    c-space
        Contour space. The abstraction of musical elements ordered
        from low to high disregarding their absolute values.

    cseg
        Contour segment. A contour space subset with adjacent or
        non-adjacent elements.

    cpitch
        Contour pitch. Each element of a cseg.

    contour class
        . We use Morris definition, instead Friedmann (see Friedmann
        1987).

    contour equivalence
        .

    prime form
        .

    normal form
        A contour representation in which elements are enumerated in
        integers from 0, to lowest cpitch to n - 1, to highest pitch,
        where n is contour cardinality. Equal to Friedmann contour
        class.

    internal diagonal
        The diagonals above zero main diagonal in a Comparison
        Matrix. Equal to Friedmann Contour Adjacency Series (CAS).

    contour adjacency series vector (CASV)
        Two digit summation of ups and downs in Contour Adjacency
        Series of a contour segment. The first digit signifies ups,
        and second, downs.

    contour interval
        Diference between two cpitch values in a cseg.

    contour interval succession
        A succession of all adjacent contour intervals in a cseg.

    contour interval array
        An array with the multiplicity of contour intervals types in a
        cseg.

    contour class vector I
        Two digit summation of the frequency of ups and
        downs. Final result is the sum of number of elements and
        contour interval multiplication.

    contour class vector II
        Two digit summation of the frequency of ups and downs. Final
        result is the sum of number of elements of a contour interval
        type.

    contour similarity
        .

    embed contour
        .
